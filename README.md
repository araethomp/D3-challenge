<h1>D3 Homework - Data Journalism and D3</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Welcome to the newsroom! You've just accepted a data visualization position for a major metro paper. You're tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings.</p>
<p>The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. She's counting on you to sniff out the first story idea by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.</p>
<p>The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau, but you are free to investigate a different data set. The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error." </p>

<h2>Before You Begin</h2>
<p><br>Create a new repository for this project called D3-Challenge. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.
<br>Clone the new repository to your computer.
<br>Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the D3 challenge. Use the folder name to correspond to the challenge: D3_data_journalism.
<br>This homework utilizes both html and Javascript so be sure to add all the necessary files. These will be the main files to run for analysis.
<br>Push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.</p>
<h2>Your Task</h2>
<p><br>You need to create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age.
<br>Using the D3 techniques we taught you in class, create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. You'll code this graphic in the app.js file of your homework directory—make sure you pull in the data from data.csv by using the d3.csv function. Your scatter plot should ultimately appear like the image at the top of this section.
<br>Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.</p>
